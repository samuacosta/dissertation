	abstract = {Accurate deleteriousness prediction for nonsynonymous variants is crucial for distinguishing pathogenic mutations from background polymorphisms in whole exome sequencing (WES) studies. Although many deleteriousness prediction methods have been developed, their prediction results are sometimes inconsistent with each other and their relative merits are still unclear in practical applications. To address these issues, we comprehensively evaluated the predictive performance of 18 current deleteriousness-scoring methods, including 11 function prediction scores (PolyPhen-2, SIFT, MutationTaster, Mutation Assessor, FATHMM, LRT, PANTHER, PhD-SNP, SNAP, SNPs\&GO and MutPred), 3 conservation scores (GERP++, SiPhy and PhyloP) and 4 ensemble scores (CADD, PON-P, KGGSeq and CONDEL). We found that FATHMM and KGGSeq had the highest discriminative power among independent scores and ensemble scores, respectively. Moreover, to ensure unbiased performance evaluation of these prediction scores, we manually collected three distinct testing datasets, on which no current prediction scores were tuned. In addition, we developed two new ensemble scores that integrate nine independent scores and allele frequency. Our scores achieved the highest discriminative power compared with all the deleteriousness prediction scores tested and showed low false-positive prediction rate for benign yet rare nonsynonymous variants, which demonstrated the value of combining information from multiple orthologous approaches. Finally, to facilitate variant prioritization in WES studies, we have pre-computed our ensemble scores for 87 347 044 possible variants in the whole-exome and made them publicly available through the ANNOVAR software and the dbNSFP database.},

A large number of in silico tools have been employed for the task of pathogenicity prediction, including PolyPhen-2, SIFT, FatHMM, MutationTaster-2, MutationAssessor, Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion, LRT, phyloP, and GERP++, as well as optimized methods of combining tool scores, such as Condel and Logit. Due to the wealth of these methods, an important practical question to answer is which of these tools generalize best, that is, correctly predict the pathogenic character of new variants. We here demonstrate in a study of 10 tools on five datasets that such a comparative evaluation of these tools is hindered by two types of circularity: they arise due to (1) the same variants or (2) different variants from the same protein occurring both in the datasets used for training and for evaluation of these tools, which may lead to overly optimistic results. We show that comparative evaluations of predictors that do not address these types of circularity may erroneously conclude that circularity confounded tools are most accurate among all tools, and may even outperform optimized combinations of tools.},

The accuracy of in silico pathogenicity prediction tools has not been previously assessed for variants associated with autosomal recessive deafness 1A (DFNB1A). Here, we identify in silico tools with the most accurate clinical significance predictions for missense variants of the GJB2 (Cx26), GJB6 (Cx30), and GJB3 (Cx31) connexin genes associated with DFNB1A. To evaluate accuracy of selected in silico tools (SIFT, FATHMM, MutationAssessor, PolyPhen-2, CONDEL, MutationTaster, MutPred, Align GVGD, and PROVEAN), we tested nine missense variants with previously confirmed clinical significance in a large cohort of deaf patients and control groups from the Sakha Republic (Eastern Siberia, Russia): ??26: p.Val27Ile, p.Met34Thr, p.Val37Ile, p.Leu90Pro, p.Glu114Gly, p.Thr123Asn, and p.Val153Ile; Cx30: p.Glu101Lys; Cx31: p.Ala194Thr. We compared the performance of the in silico tools (accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity) by using the missense variants in GJB2 (Cx26), GJB6 (Cx30), and GJB3 (Cx31) genes associated with DFNB1A. The correlation coefficient (r) and coefficient of the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve as alternative quality indicators of the tested programs were used. The resulting ROC curves demonstrated that the largest coefficient of the area under the curve was provided by three programs: SIFT (AUC = 0.833, p = 0.046), PROVEAN (AUC = 0.833, p = 0.046), and MutationAssessor (AUC = 0.833, p = 0.002). The most accurate predictions were given by two tested programs: SIFT and PROVEAN (Ac = 89\%, Se = 67\%, Sp = 100\%, r = 0.75, AUC = 0.833). The results of this study may be applicable for analysis of novel missense variants of the GJB2 (Cx26), GJB6 (Cx30), and GJB3 (Cx31) connexin genes.},

The choice of these tools is critical for reliable variant impact interpretation for precision medicine and should be based on systematic performance assessment.

To address this issue, we obtained 63,160 common amino acid substitutions (allele frequency >=1\% and {\textless}25\%) from the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) database, which contains variants from 60,706 genomes or exomes. We evaluated the specificity, the capability to detect benign variants, for 10 variant interpretation tools. In addition to overall specificity of the tools, we tested their performance for variants in six geographical populations. PON-P2 had the best performance (95.5\%) followed by FATHMM (86.4\%) and VEST (83.5\%). While these tools had excellent performance, the poorest method predicted more than one third of the benign variants to be disease-causing. The results allow choosing reliable methods for benign variant interpretation, for both research and clinical purposes, as well as provide a benchmark for method developers.},

The performance of 17 publicly available pathogenicity prediction programs was assayed using a dataset consisting of 122 credibly pathogenic and benign variants in genes associated with the RASopathy family of disorders and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. Performance metrics were compared between the programs to determine the most accurate program for loss-of-function and gain-of-function mechanisms. No one program correctly predicted the pathogenicity of all variants analyzed. A major hindrance to the analysis was the lack of output from a significant portion of the programs. The best performer was MutPred, which had a weighted accuracy of 82.6\% in the full dataset. Surprisingly, combining the results of the top three programs did not increase the ability to predict pathogenicity over the top performer alone. As the increasing number of sequence changes in larger datasets will require interpretation, the current study demonstrates that extreme caution must be taken when reporting pathogenicity based on statistical online protein prediction programs in the absence of functional studies.},

Some human genomic variants are associated with common traits such as hair and eye color, while others are associated with susceptibility to disease or response to drug treatment. Identifying the human variations producing clinically relevant phenotypic changes is critical for providing accurate and personalized diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment for diseases. Furthermore, a better understanding of the molecular underpinning of disease can lead to development of new drug targets for precision medicine. Several resources have been designed for collecting and storing human genomic variations in highly structured, easily accessible databases. Unfortunately, a vast amount of information about these genetic variants and their functional and phenotypic associations is currently buried in the literature, only accessible by manual curation or sophisticated text text-mining technology to extract the relevant information. In addition, the low cost of sequencing technologies coupled with increasing computational power has enabled the development of numerous computational methodologies to predict the pathogenicity of human variants. This review provides a detailed comparison of current human variant resources, including HGMD, OMIM, ClinVar, and UniProt/Swiss-Prot, followed by an overview of the computational methods and techniques used to leverage the available data to predict novel deleterious variants. We expect these resources and tools to become the foundation for understanding the molecular details of genomic variants leading to disease, which in turn will enable the promise of precision medicine.},

A gold standard~list was assembled of 4319 somatic single-nucleotide variants, classified as oncogenic (n = 2996) or neutral (n = 1323), based on their presence in curated databases or on their allele frequency in the general population. These variants were annotated with the most commonly used prediction tools [dbNSFP (Database for Nonsynonymous SNPs{\textquoteright} Functional Predictions)and UMD-Predictor (University of Minnesota Duluth Predictor)] and computed performance calculations. Stratification of the prediction tools based on Matthews correlation coefficient and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve allowed the identification of the top-performing ones, namely, CADD (Combined Annotation-Dependent Depletion), Eigen or Eigen-PC (Eigen Principal Components), PolyPhen-2 (Polymorphism Phenotyping version 2), PROVEAN (Protein Variation Effect Analyzer), UMD-Predictor, and REVEL (Rare Exome Variant Ensemble Learner). Interestingly, SIFT (Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant), which is a commonly used prediction tool for somatic variants, was ranked in the second performance category.

	abstract = {As next-generation sequencing projects generate massive genome-wide sequence variation data, bioinformatics tools are being developed to provide computational predictions on the functional effects of sequence variations and narrow down the search of casual variants for disease phenotypes. Different classes of sequence variations at the nucleotide level are involved in human diseases, including substitutions, insertions, deletions, frameshifts, and non-sense mutations. Frameshifts and non-sense mutations are likely to cause a negative effect on protein function. Existing prediction tools primarily focus on studying the deleterious effects of single amino acid substitutions through examining amino acid conservation at the position of interest among related sequences, an approach that is not directly applicable to insertions or deletions. Here, we introduce a versatile alignment-based score as a new metric to predict the damaging effects of variations not limited to single amino acid substitutions but also in-frame insertions, deletions, and multiple amino acid substitutions. This alignment-based score measures the change in sequence similarity of a query sequence to a protein sequence homolog before and after the introduction of an amino acid variation to the query sequence. Our results showed that the scoring scheme performs well in separating disease-associated variants (n = 21,662) from common polymorphisms (n = 37,022) for UniProt human protein variations, and also in separating deleterious variants (n = 15,179) from neutral variants (n = 17,891) for UniProt non-human protein variations. In our approach, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the human and non-human protein variation datasets is \~{}0.85. We also observed that the alignment-based score correlates with the deleteriousness of a sequence variation. In summary, we have developed a new algorithm, PROVEAN (Protein Variation Effect Analyzer), which provides a generalized approach to predict the functional effects of protein sequence variations including single or multiple amino acid substitutions, and in-frame insertions and deletions. The PROVEAN tool is available online at http://provean.jcvi.org.},

This measure is the overall resemblance between the 20 {\textquotedblleft}natural{\textquotedblright} amino acids based on a large number of their physico-chemical properties. The amino acids were classified into groups similar in many ways to those commonly recognized. A Principal Component analysis yielded four vectors, which represent major composite chemical factors. Correlations were studied between the change in biological activity and the chemical change on substitution of one or more amino acids. As expected, there was in general a major change in biological activity if a major change was made in chemical structure. The variation was due to three effects: (a) a correlation between activity and overall resemblance of individual pairs of amino acids (as shown by comparisons involving only a single amino acid substitution); (b) a correlation with the total number of amino acids substituted, irrespective of which ones they were; and (c), the major part, variation that was unaccounted for by (a) or (b). Correlations were also noted between the four vectors and biological activity. This suggests that predictions on the biological activity of new peptides might be possible. Such predictions would probably be better than chance, though not of high accuracy.},

Outside of {\textquoteleft}abnormal{\textquoteright} proteins, the correlation also does not apply to certain regions of proteins characterized by rapid rates of substitution. In these cases again, except for the largest physico-chemical differences between amino acid pairs, the substitution frequencies seem to be independent of the physico-chemical parameters. The limination of the substituents involving the largest physicochemical differences can once more be attributed to natural selection. For smaller physico-chemical differences, natural selection, if it is operating in the polypeptide regions, must be based on parameters other than those examined.},

Here we show that nonpolar/polar interactions, namely Val or Ile bonding to Lys or Arg in $\alpha$-helices, can in fact be stabilizing. Residues spaced i, i + 4 in $\alpha$-helices are on the same face of the helix, with potential to favorably interact and stabilize the structure. We observe that the nonpolar/polar pairs Ile-Lys, Ile-Arg, and Val-Lys occur in protein helices more often than expected when spaced i, i + 4. Partially helical peptides containing pairs of nonpolar/polar residues were synthesized. Controls with i, i + 5 spacing have the residues on opposite faces of the helix and are less helical than the test peptides with the i, i + 4 interactions. Experimental circular dichroism results were analyzed with helix-coil theory to calculate the free energy for the interactions. All three stabilize the helix with ?G between ?0.14 and ?0.32 kcal {\textperiodcentered} mol?1. The interactions are hydrophobic with contacts between Val or Ile and the alkyl groups in Arg or Lys. Side chains such as Lys and Arg can thus interact favorably with both polar and nonpolar residues. Proteins 2001;45:449?455. ? 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Here we describe the aggregation of 125,748 exomes and 15,708 genomes from human sequencing studies into the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD). We identify 443,769 high-confidence predicted loss-of-function variants in this cohort after filtering for artefacts caused by sequencing and annotation errors. Using an improved model of human mutation rates, we classify human protein-coding genes along a spectrum that represents tolerance to inactivation, validate this classification using data from model organisms and engineered human cells, and show that it can be used to improve the power of gene discovery for both common and rare diseases.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT The rate at which nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) are being identified in the human genome is increasing dramatically owing to advances in whole-genome/whole-exome sequencing technologies. Automated methods capable of accurately and reliably distinguishing between pathogenic and functionally neutral nsSNPs are therefore assuming ever-increasing importance. Here, we describe the Functional Analysis Through Hidden Markov Models (FATHMM) software and server: a species-independent method with optional species-specific weightings for the prediction of the functional effects of protein missense variants. Using a model weighted for human mutations, we obtained performance accuracies that outperformed traditional prediction methods (i.e., SIFT, PolyPhen, and PANTHER) on two separate benchmarks. Furthermore, in one benchmark, we achieve performance accuracies that outperform current state-of-the-art prediction methods (i.e., SNPs\&GO and MutPred). We demonstrate that FATHMM can be efficiently applied to high-throughput/large-scale human and nonhuman genome sequencing projects with the added benefit of phenotypic outcome associations. To illustrate this, we evaluated nsSNPs in wheat (Triticum spp.) to identify some of the important genetic variants responsible for the phenotypic differences introduced by intense selection during domestication. A Web-based implementation of FATHMM, including a high-throughput batch facility and a downloadable standalone package, is available at http://fathmm.biocompute.org.uk.},

	abstract = {We introduce MutPred2, a tool that improves the prioritization of pathogenic amino acid substitutions, generates molecular mechanisms potentially causative of disease, and returns interpretable pathogenicity score distributions on individual genomes. While its prioritization performance is state-of-the-art, a novel and distinguishing feature of MutPred2 is the probabilistic modeling of variant impact on specific aspects of protein structure and function that can serve to guide experimental studies of phenotype-altering variants. We demonstrate the utility of MutPred2 in the identification of the structural and functional mutational signatures relevant to Mendelian disorders and the prioritization of de novo mutations associated with complex neurodevelopmental disorders. We then experimentally validate the functional impact of several variants identified in patients with such disorders. We argue that mechanism-driven studies of human inherited diseases have the potential to significantly accelerate the discovery of clinically actionable variants.Availability: http://mutpred.mutdb.org/},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Whole exome sequencing studies identify hundreds to thousands of rare  protein coding variants of ambiguous significance for human health. Computational  tools are needed to accelerate the identification of specific variants and genes  that contribute to human disease. RESULTS: We have developed the Variant Effect  Scoring Tool (VEST), a supervised machine learning-based classifier, to prioritize  rare missense variants with likely involvement in human disease. The VEST classifier  training set comprised {\textasciitilde} 45,000 disease mutations from the latest Human Gene  Mutation Database release and another {\textasciitilde}45,000 high frequency (allele frequency {\textgreater}1\%)  putatively neutral missense variants from the Exome Sequencing Project. VEST  outperforms some of the most popular methods for prioritizing missense variants in  carefully designed holdout benchmarking experiments (VEST ROC AUC = 0.91, PolyPhen2  ROC AUC = 0.86, SIFT4.0 ROC AUC = 0.84). VEST estimates variant score p-values  against a null distribution of VEST scores for neutral variants not included in the  VEST training set. These p-values can be aggregated at the gene level across  multiple disease exomes to rank genes for probable disease involvement. We tested  the ability of an aggregate VEST gene score to identify candidate Mendelian disease  genes, based on whole-exome sequencing of a small number of disease cases. We used  whole-exome data for two Mendelian disorders for which the causal gene is known.  Considering only genes that contained variants in all cases, the VEST gene score  ranked dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) number 2 of 2253 genes in four cases of  Miller syndrome, and myosin-3 (MYH3) number 2 of 2313 genes in three cases of  Freeman Sheldon syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the potential power  gain of aggregating bioinformatics variant scores into gene-level scores and the  general utility of bioinformatics in assisting the search for disease genes in  large-scale exome sequencing studies. VEST is available as a stand-alone software  package at http://wiki.chasmsoftware.org and is hosted by the CRAVAT web server at  http://www.cravat.us.},

	abstract = {Combined Annotation-Dependent Depletion (CADD) is a widely used measure of variant deleteriousness that can effectively prioritize causal variants in genetic analyses, particularly highly penetrant contributors to severe Mendelian disorders. CADD is an integrative annotation built from more than 60 genomic features, and can score human single nucleotide variants and short insertion and deletions anywhere in the reference assembly. CADD uses a machine learning model trained on a binary distinction between simulated de novo variants and variants that have arisen and become fixed in human populations since the split between humans and chimpanzees; the former are free of selective pressure and may thus include both neutral and deleterious alleles, while the latter are overwhelmingly neutral (or, at most, weakly deleterious) by virtue of having survived millions of years of purifying selection. Here we review the latest updates to CADD, including the most recent version, 1.4, which supports the human genome build GRCh38. We also present updates to our website that include simplified variant lookup, extended documentation, an Application Program Interface and improved mechanisms for integrating CADD scores into other tools or applications. CADD scores, software and documentation are available at https://cadd.gs.washington.edu.},
